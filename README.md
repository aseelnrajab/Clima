# Clima

 A beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.
 This app was an introduction for me  to the wonderful world of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet.
